# LLM-document-QA
This is a simple implementation of an LLM Based QA engine over custom CSV Input Data.

## Quickstart
* Copy the code into your own Colab Notebook.
* Update the OpenAI API Key.\
(You can get your  own key from here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

* Upload your csv file to the Colab runtime (alternatively, if your csv is in your google drive, you can mount your drive)
* Change the path of the file to your file's name.\
(Note: I have also provided a shortened data.csv from the Kaggle dataset linkedin the code)\

* Update the questions.
(Note: I have already placed some sample questions pertaining to the dataset mentioned in the code.)

* Run the last cell to get your AI-powered answers!
